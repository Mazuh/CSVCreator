# CSV Creator

A light and portable Comma Separated Values (CSV) file editor.

It's still a prototype missing a few functions, but it's functional.

## Development environment

Java 8 (Oracle SDK) with JavaFX jar included via Netbean's project (and, btw, I'm using Netbeans 8). After cloning the repository, you can run javadoc for easy reading the docs.

## Distribution

Download the latest .jar on [releases page](https://github.com/Mazuh/CSVCreator/releases).
